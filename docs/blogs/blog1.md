# Integrating ScriptChain Health with Clinical Workflows

One of the biggest challenges in digital health is integrating patient-generated data with clinical systems. ScriptChain Health addresses this by:

- Offering an API layer compatible with most EHR systems
- Supporting HL7 and FHIR standards
- Providing real-time patient alerts to clinicians

Future work includes predictive analytics and genomic data integrations.
